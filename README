This repo contains work from Udacity's Intro to HTML and CSS course.

The 3 subdirectories are:
toplist (lesson 1): very basic html and css
framework (lesson 3): introducing a generic and reusable css
bootstrap (lesson 4): using the publicly available bootstrap css

I keep using this repo for practice with html, css, and git/github.
